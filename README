XnatSynchronization scripts
===========================

Used to synchronize the imaging data on the RPACS xnat instance to
the predict xnat instance, then sync the predict xnat imaging data
to the filesystem under /paulsen/MRx/.

To use, correctly populate the configuration variables in syncConfig.cfg
similar to the example in sync.Config.example. 

These scripts have a number of dependencies.  To use them, first install
the required modules using:

pip install --user keyring
pip install --user httplib2
pip install --user pyxnat
pip install --user pydicom

If a password is not stored in the keyring of the machine you are
running the script on you will be prompted for the password.  After
a password has been entered it will be stored in the keyring.  To change
the stored password run:

$ python RunSynchronization.py --setPassword

You will be prompted for your password. 

To automate things simply create a cron job to execute this script.  An
example that is executed nightly at 1:00am would look like:
crontab:
1 1 * * * python $PATHTOSCRIPT/RunSynchronization.py
